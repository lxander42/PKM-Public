## Notes
- Make an H202 rocket which is self-regulating 
	- surface tension decides how much flow you get, you have a bunch of holes of various diameter so that at a given surface tension, H202 only flows through certain holes exposing it to surface area of silver which is enough to vaporize the given flow rate of hydrogen peroxide. You use a passive one way valve like the tesla valve to make sure gas is not pressurizing the liquid, but rather exiting the nozzle. 
	- The rocket is then completely controlled by the inlet liquid pressure. 
	- A true monofuel propellant which has entirely non-moving components and can be controlled with a simple mfc and pressure sensor. 
	- This guy has a good video with some different catalysts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkw0jOS68as
	- his site, hard to find: http://www.swissrocketman.fr/catalyseurs-h2o2%2cfr%2c8%2c66.html
	- Uses perovskite oxide synthesized with sol-gel process on gamma aluminum oxide
