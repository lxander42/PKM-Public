# [[Fiverr Gig Orders]]

## Description 
This is a note to hold all the fiverr gigs I have quoted for reuse in future gigs. 

## Types of orders 

### Manufacturing and Assembly
Here is what I can do for you: 
- Working with suppliers to quote all parts and the assembly of the parts 
- Potential Design For Manufacturing (DFM) changes of the drawings and/or parts 

**For a simple assembly (3-10 parts)** 
$500 and 2 week lead time. Does not include cost to manufacture and assemble parts, that is variable and will depend on quoting. I will keep in communication with you throughout the process and give you quotes in which you can pay the vendor directly. 

Keep in mind, working with suppliers can take time and I may request extensions as necessary, I hope you are OK with that. 

Shipping not included as I cannot estimate it at this time.

#### Requirements (I will ask for these upon order)
- All part files in STEP format 
- All part drawings 
- Desired material of all parts
- Estimated annual production 
- Any certifications required (ITAR, UL94V, etc...)
	- This is really only relevant if you need rocket designs or flammability prevention.
