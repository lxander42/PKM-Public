A couple of things that have changed with the description. 

Looking for someone to get concept on paper and build the prototype. If the prototype goes well, they would be the one producing the product. 

Features: 
- Custom made, not like a normal fridge

- Size 
	- 30cm cube up to around 50 or 60 externally 
	- On the inside, just need an empty space to put stuff in

- Features
	- Door of fridge needs to open from the top, not the side 
	- be able to open the door from a distance 
		- bluetooth
		- internet 
		- radio 
	- Rechargeable battery 
		- solar panel on top 
		- needs fridge to run 24 hours per week
	- As soon as the food is dropped inside, this turns on
	- IP67 water resistance 

- Concept
	- Using the fridge to make deliveries 
	- Send to clients and it sits in their yard and waits for deliver 
	- Need the product to be functional at the lowest cost possible.
