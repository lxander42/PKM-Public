**Project Title:** Mini Fridge with Battery Power

**Quote Date:** [[2023-11-08]]

**Client:** Ainesh

**Description:** We will be developing a custom mini fridge that is battery-powered, weatherproof (IP67 rated except for evaporator outlet), remotely accessible, and equipped with a rechargeable battery and a solar panel for continuous operation. The door will open from the top and have various remote access options, including Bluetooth, internet, or radio control. The primary use case is for making deliveries and ensuring the lowest possible production cost while maintaining functionality.

**Scope of Work:**

1. **Concept and Design Phase:**
	1. **Initial Concept Development:**
		- Brainstorming and idea generation
		- Preliminary sketches and concept exploration
		- Estimation of power consumption and cooling capacity
		- Rough outline of electrical and system diagram
		- Rough CAD model 
		- Rough BOM Cost for prototype and HVM
		- Initial concept design review to be approved by stakeholders
		- **Estimated Cost:** $1000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

	2. **Cooling and power system procurement and testing**
		- Purchase appropriately sized cooling system and associated power delivery components for feasibility testing
		- Testing of equipment in disassembled state to prove cooling capacity and power consumption calculations
		- Does not include component cost
		- **Estimated Cost:** $5,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months

	3. **Detailed 2D and 3D Design:**
    
		- Creating detailed 2D and 3D designs based on the selected concept
		- Iterative design revisions
		- **Estimated Cost:** $5,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

	4. **Rechargeable Battery and Solar Integration (Week 6-8):**
		- Designing the battery and solar panel integration into the fridge
		- Ensuring energy efficiency and cooling capacity
		- Wiring diagrams with assembly instructions
		- **Estimated Cost:** $4,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

	5. **Remote Access Technology Integration (Week 9-11):**    
		- Integrating Bluetooth, internet, or radio control for remote access
		- Developing the control system
		- **Estimated Cost:** $3,500
		- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

	6. **Weatherproofing for IP67 (Week 12-13):**
		- Finalizing the weatherproofing design
		- Testing for IP67 rating
		- **Estimated Cost:** $2,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

	7. **Final Design Review and Adjustments (Week 14-16):**
		- Comprehensive design review and adjustments
		- Ensuring all elements work together seamlessly
		- **Estimated Cost:** $2,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks

	8. **Cost Analysis and Feasibility Study (Week 17):**
		- Evaluating the overall project cost
		- Determining the feasibility of production at the lowest cost
		- Finding list of potential HVM suppliers
		- **Estimated Cost:** $1,000
		- **Estimated Duration:** 1 week

**Total Estimated Cost for Concept and Design Phase:** $23,500
**Total Estimated Duration for Concept and Design Phase:**  32 weeks

2. **Prototype Development:**
    
    - Building a functional prototype based on the approved design
    - Integration and testing of all specified features
    - Refinements and adjustments based on prototype testing
    - Estimated Duration: 2 months (not including part procurement)
    - Estimated Cost: $5000 (not including parts)

**Estimated total development cost**: $28,500
**Estimated total development time**: 40 weeks
