# [[Desk Organizer Rev 2]]
Started [[2023-10-29]]

## Description 
The first desk organizer was meant to hold all my tech accessories, I want to expand it to hold more things that I consistently want to keep at my desk. See below for picture of original.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to include the contents listed below in the layout shown. This should all be mounted to the bottom of my desk magnetically. See [[Magnets]]. 

Items to include: 
- Brush
- magnets
- kvm swtich 
- Pens 
- Sticky notes
- chapstick 
- Weekly pill organizer

With the brush under the relatively flat components as shown:

Additionally, all this needs to be able to mount underneath the desk with a magnetic interface. Scratch that, the underside of the desk is non-magnetic. So, I plan on having a kind of drawer like system that clips to the edge of the table and doubles as a headphone stand. 

## Notes
- Maybe I should just make these stackable, it is getting too large. 
- That is the new goal, make them stackable and compatible with [[../../3RESOURCES/STANDARDS/Gridfinity]]

Heres how it turned out before printing:
