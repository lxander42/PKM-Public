# Scope

This is a project to create a top down RPG game. A 2d action game built in the [Unity Game Engine](../../../5INBOX/New/Unity%20Game%20Engine.md)

# Notes

## Role of EOS Rods

Eos rods prevent enemy spawning in dungeon rooms, once an entire dungeon has been sealed, the external dungeon sprite does an animation and the dungeon is shown as liberated on the map. Until then, you have to place guards outside the dungeon to prevent the spawned enemies from overrunning the territory. Rooms have portals in them that spawn enemies periodically. 

## Story (written by [[Trevor Alexander]])

**Nym’s Rod**

**Main Arc**

You are a PC adventurer, the character wakes up not knowing who they are and can name and create themselves. PC goes through a mini tutorial before getting led to their first dungeon by the screams of a person in need. A woman and child are being accosted in their cottage. the PC chases a large zombie into the cellar the zombie had abducted the child and fled, you go down the dungeon before killing the boss and rescuing the kid. At the end of the first dungeon they can either rescue the kid immediately and lose treasure to escaping goblins or let the kid die and fight the goblins to get extra treasure to help in the boss fight. This introduces morality to the game, there’s not necessarily a morality mechanic but for RPers they might like choices. PC now with new loot and XP exits to confront the Mom, if you return with the kid the mom shows you a box of treasure some goblins came out the the cellar carrying and she killed them. the treasure here is what you would have lost if you chose to save the kid. If you exit the dungeon without the kid you can flee into the forest without confronting the mom and stay rich.

At the bottom of the dungeon you got an overworld map that illuminates the hidden 6 adjacent hexes or 4 adjacent squares depending on what map tiling you want to use. This map shows rudimentary monster skrawling showing the difficulty of nearby dungeon hexes

You now are set loose to fight through dungeon after dungeon amassing treasure and gear money and ”eos rods” the magical shards you get from killing elite monsters, every once and a while the map’s you find illuminate a town you can visit but the map shows monsters planning to attack so if you don’t visit in your next travel phase the town gets wiped and turned into a dungeon

dungeons have side quest, the main quest progresses after visiting x number of villages and then progresses again after visiting y number etc. 

once in villages you can spend your eos rods on crafting magical armor or weapons at the blacksmith and spells at the wizards tower poisons and light armor in the sewer thieves guild, there’s no class system but there’s basic concepts of them - rogue fighter wizard cleric, these concepts are tied to the spells and equipment you get bonuses from you can mix and match for whatever play style you like. 

Once they reach story points they meet up with Jah Broan an adventurer from their past who starts feeding them bits of their backstory before having to run off and kill monsters.

The PC at some point is told to reforge the sword of legends after a wizard sees the Rusted Rod, they’re tasked with hunting down the 3 shards of prophecy which are the shards of the Legendary sword Nym’s Rod each shard has a letter engraved on it. the first shard was in the tutorial clearing stabbed into the head of a zombie and it had N on it. they quest for the Y and M shard and then have to reforge it in a volcano.

At some point the character learns their dead name and they remember who they are. They’re given a choice to either accept and return to who they were in the past or abandon that history and remain who they’ve become and their name will either change to Nym if they return or stay the same as they fully become “PC”.

Finally with nyms rod PC or Nym (whichever they now are) can finally make the final push to the necromancer's lair, the evil villain who has been resurrecting monsters endlessly. and with nyms rod Pc is finally able to slay the villain and save the day

pc can still hunt dungeons endlessly but dungeons don’t regenerate/reform now 

Intro/Tutorial

PC wakes up with a “rusted hilt engraved with the word Rod” at their side and at low health and a few coins floating on the ground nearby dead zombies litter the edge of the clearing

movement mechanic tutorial, go pick up the coins

harvest zombie corpse for food which looks like chicken leg or ham hock which goes on your hotbar

there’s another zombie on the edge of the clearing with half a blade sticking out of its head, this is “Rusted Blade engraved with the Letter N” secret name The Shard of Nim which can be reforged later to make one of the best swords in the game The Sword of Nim

nearby bush rumbles and a live zombie pops out

kill the zombie OR secret move attack the zombie with the chicken leg food club which feeds the zombie and it becomes your friend for a set amount of time and will fight with you

right now you can only have a maximum of 1 pet monster

PC hears a scream coming from the next zone, they have to leave the clearing and enter the forest to follow it

they approach a little house in the forest, inside is a woman and child being cornered by a big zombie and 2 little ones, you rush in to help kill the zombies, you kill one and the woman grabs a poker and helps kill the other small one. but the big guy grabs the kid and shambles down a trapdoor into the cellar, this is the entrance to the first dungeon
