# Description

Wanted to see deformation of wrist clamp with a static load high enough to get it to clamp. It looks like it is still within the yield stress of PLA at 26MPa. Report formatted below exported from Fusion 360. 

This was done as a part of the wrist assembly design for the [Articulated TV Mounting Arm](Articulated%20TV%20Mounting%20Arm.md) project.
