# Scope

## Objectives

Design and build a Mounting arm from only 3d printed and off the shelf parts for the CRT TV outlined in [Articulated TV mounting Arm Drawings](Articulated%20TV%20mounting%20Arm%20Drawings.md). 

## Requirements

- Support a 15lb TV 50" away from the wall with a static loading factor of safety of 1.5. 
- Have the ability to tilt the TV from 0 to -60 degrees from horizontal. 
- Aside from the TV tilt mechanism, the assembly shall remain stationary without external support. 
- Entire assembly shall be mountable to drywall or plaster wall material. 
- Cable routing shall be provided for 1 power cable and 1 signal cable to and from the TV to the base of the assembly. 
- When collapsed to the wall, assembly shall not protrude more than 4" excluding the TV.

**Out of Scope**: 
- Cosmetic design elements
- Automation of any kind
- Peripheral mounting
