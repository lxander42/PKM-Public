## Description 
I want to develop a pyramid training plan which scales based on my fitness level. 

I want to have excellent cardio, it just makes life feel easier when you have good cardio. I want cardio to be the base of my fitness pyramid, then core strength, then the ATG mobility exercises, then the big compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, row). Then and only then I want to work on the specific muscles. I want to be an athlete, I feel like I kind of denied myself that as a kid. I never thought I was good enough, but I am good enough, I have found I can go for a long time at high power without much training.
