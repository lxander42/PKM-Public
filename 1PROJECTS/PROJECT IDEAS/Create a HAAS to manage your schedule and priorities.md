## Description 
I was exploring the idea of [Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)](HAAS))).md) and thought it would be really handy to have something that has real time access to my [Personal Knowledge Management](../../2AREAS/PERSONAL%20KNOWLEDGE%20MANAGEMENT/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) system and [My Productivity System](../../2AREAS/PRODUCTIVITY/My%20Productivity%20System.md) and can manage my schedule for me, deciding what to do each day. I could even integrate my email so it could be like my personal assistant, just giving me the highlights and telling me what I have going on for the day.
