- `The Thought:` I want to explore Hydrogen power sources, how to make hydrides, charge them, discharge them, working with batteries and the necessary subsystems

## General notes
- The storage capacity of the metal hydride storage is at 1.5kg - or 50 kWh energy - hydrogen per 100kg of the metal hydride compound material. As a comparison, this is close to the energy capacity of a standard Lithium Ion battery offered in a Tesla Model 3 vehicle.

	- Energy capacity of gasoline: 46.4 MJ/kg 
	- Efficiency of ICE: 40%
	- Energy per kg: 18.6MJ
	- Energy capacity of Hydrogen: 120 MJ/kg (hydride)
	- Efficiency of Hydrogen fuel cells: 60%
	- Total Energy per kg: 72MJ
	- 3.8x that of gasoline for the same weight
