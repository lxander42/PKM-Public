## Description 
My productivity system was created when I was buried with work and needed to relieve stress and ensure nothing fell through the cracks. There needed to be clear decisions as to why I was doing certain things at certain times and a framework which helped me outline this process. This system was created within the framework of my [Personal Knowledge Management](../PERSONAL%20KNOWLEDGE%20MANAGEMENT/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) system. 

## The Mission 
The mission, or goal, of this system is to allow its user to have their average perfect day as often as possible. This means having a day with minimal stress, maximum productivity, not forgetting about anything, and being able to easily make decisions on important things in one's life. 

## The scope of the system 
People generally have an amorphous idea of what constitutes productivity - I have distilled it down into these tools for myself: 
- A todo list: a place to capture anything and everything you plan to get done. 
- A calendar: what you are will do at certain times.
- A file organization structure: where references, resources, and files are located. 
- A notes app: to hold all of your written notes on projects and other things. 
- A bookmark management system: to hold all the web links you access regularly. 
- An email client: self explanatory. 

This framework defines how these work in conjunction with one another and the role that they fill. 
## The apps I use
- Todo list: [Todoist | A To-Do List to Organize Your Work & Life](https://todoist.com/)
- Calendar: Outlook 
- File organization: Onedrive
- A notes app: [Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking](https://obsidian.md/)
	- A plaintext notes app
- Web links: I use a browser extension called BrainTool - [Go beyond Bookmarks with BrainTool, the online Topic Manager | BrainTool - Beyond Bookmarks](https://braintool.org/index.html)
- Email client: I use outlook and gmail for personal use. 

**Feel free to choose the apps that work best for you**, this is meant to be flexible. Microsoft has enterprise solutions for all of the apps listed previously. 
## Organization
I use [The PARA Method: The Simple System for Organizing Your Digital Life in Seconds (fortelabs.com)](fortelabs.com)))

I find that it is the most well thought out organization system that I have tried thus far. It is broken up into 4 categories: 

- **Projects:** Projects that you are currently working on, short term efforts you take on with a certain goal in mind. 
	- examples: PPL/EPL projects, PRs, Buying a house, Planning for a trip, etc....
- **Areas:** Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time 
	- examples: Mechanical Engineering, Finance, Fitness, etc...
- **Resources:** Topics you are interested in (they may become areas someday)
	- examples: Graphic design, thermal systems, robotics, fluid mechanics
- **Archive:** Anything from the previous categories that is no longer active but you might want to have for reference. 

Everything in your productivity apps should be organized the same way, that is, when you switch from app to app, everything will be in the same "place". 

For example: I am working on a PowerPoint presentation for a design review and I save it under my "PPL31 project folder", I then remember I need to do something for that project so I quickly add a task to the "PPL31 task list". When I switch from my file system to the task list it almost looks as if the content is mirrored. This minimizes switching mental gears and allows you to seamlessly move from task to task. 

## How it works in practice 
### C.O.P.E. 

#### Capture 
**Quick Capture** 
The entire point of this system is to quickly get things into your system so you don't have to think about it, that means there needs to be quick capture methods for each of the productivity tools outlined in *The Apps I use* section. This acts as our sort of "Inbox"

**Todo List**
- Todoist
	- Has hotkeys for adding tasks that are configurable, I have set mine to ctrl+space

**Calendar**
- If you are going through your day and remember something you have to do at a specific time, add it to your calendar immediately.

**File System**
- The quick capture for a file system is the downloads folder and the desktop, any time I am working or looking at a file, and don't know where to save it, I save it in the downloads or desktop folder on my computer.

**Notes App**
- OneNote
	- Windows+Alt+N will open a new quick note window that you can quickly type notes into 
	- Once you close this note it is saved in your onenote under "Quick Notes"
- Obsidian 
	- Configurable hotkeys to quickly add notes, I have configured mine to start a quick note with Alt+N

**Web Links**
- If you are in a browser and come across a website that would be nice to remember, save it to an "Inbox" folder in your bookmarks folder.
- If you are using BrainTools, use the Alt+B hotkey to save the link to your scratch pad. 

**Email**
- No need to capture quickly for your email, everything is already in your inbox! 

> [!NOTE]
> An important part of this system is doing quick tasks (<2mins) immediately, if you added all these tasks to your system you would quickly bloat it to enormous size and spend way too much time just tweaking your system. This is a concept introduced in [Getting Things Done® - David Allen's GTD® Methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).  

All this stuff gets processed in the upcoming steps, it is important to not think too hard about capturing all these fleeting tasks and just get through it as quickly as possible using the smallest amount of brainpower to minimize [Decision Fatigue](Decision%20Fatigue).
#### Organize 
Once we have our up-to-date inbox in all our tools, keep in mind the previous section in which I stated: 

> Everything in your productivity apps should be organized the same way, that is, when you switch from app to app, everything will be in the same "place". 

It is important to have each of these tools setup in the same way as outlined previously. If you do not have this done, do it now. 

In this section, we will organize all of these previously captured tasks, thoughts, notes, emails, etc... we accomplish this through the use of routines, specifically our *Morning Organization* and our *Daily Shutdown*. If you do nothing else in a day, do these things as they will help you focus your attention and "put on the blinders" so to speak. 

##### Morning Organization 
The morning organization should be a relaxing experience after you have gone through the capture step, now it is just a matter of filing everything away according to the PARA system outlined above: 

You should schedule 30 minutes to an hour a day on this. 

- [ ] Turn on some good focus music (I find this really helpful)
- [ ] Sign into your VPN and password manager (if you have one)
- [ ] Go through your email and quickly add tasks to your task manager, you should not spend a lot of time on this. 
- [ ] Add/accept events to your calendar.


> [!NOTE] You're not done yet
> The remainder of the Morning organization routine is finished in the "Prioritize" section below. 

##### Daily Shutdown
In the daily shutdown, we spend 30 minutes or so saving and filing away everything we were working on throughout the day and adding to our weekly update note. 

- [ ] File away your quick notes into the appropriate folders per [The PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
- [ ] File away your bookmark inbox into the appropriate bookmark folders per [The PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
- [ ] Save any files you are currently working on per [The PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
- [ ] Clear your desktop and downloads folder per [The PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), only save what is necessary, deleting the rest. 
- [ ] Decide your 1 task for tomorrow. This is your most important/most involved task, or, the task that, if you completed, would make your day so much easier. Flag this task with Priority 1 in your task manager.
- [ ] Congratulate yourself!
#### Prioritize 
This is where the magic happens, you decide what is important and schedule your day. Let's finish the *Morning Routine* from earlier. 

##### Morning Routine Continued
- [ ] Check the tasks due today in your task manager, schedule them on your calendar (If you were selective about this, there should only be tasks that absolutely need to be done today in this bucket). 
- [ ] Schedule your top priority task you defined in the previous days *Daily Shutdown*
- [ ] Gather remaining tasks from your highest priority projects and fill up the rest of your day on your calendar. Use your best judgement for this. Try to leave 1-1.5 hours of buffer time. Trust me, you will need it.

That's it for your morning routine, I also utilize a "Weekly Update" note where I mark tasks I have completed this week and what I plan on completing next week, you can use this to help you decide which tasks should be prioritized for the week ahead. Now you have everything filed away and your calendar ready, there is only 1 more step left.

#### Execute
Just go through your calendar stress-free, knowing that you have captured everything, everything is in its place, and you are doing exactly what you need to be doing right now.


> [!NOTE] Don't Be too Rigid About it
> These are guidelines and things come up throughout the day that throw a wrench in your plans. If something comes up that needs urgent attention you should address it instead of letting it slip by because your calendar said so. However, there is a fine line between letting the world dictate your day and being intentional about it, have fun!

# Experimenting with Mark Forster's productivity systems 

[Mark Forster](../../../5INBOX/PEOPLE/Mark%20Forster.md) is a productivity author and has a bunch of productivity systems that I want to try, the reviews for all of them are linked here: [Blog - Get Everything Done (squarespace.com)](http://markforster.squarespace.com/?clickid=z4nzNhVvlxyPWf1znm3PUQIxUkH3LFQYiy-uSQ0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=pp&utm_source=Wildfire%20Systems&utm_campaign=Wildfire%20Systems&channel=pp&subchannel=390418&source=Wildfire%20Systems)
