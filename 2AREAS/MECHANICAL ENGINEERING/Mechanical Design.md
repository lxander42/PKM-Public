## Description
The process of designing objects and systems which are physical in nature and interact mechanically with their surroundings. 

When designing any mechanical system, one should try to maintain [Atomic Mechanical Design](Atomic%20Mechanical%20Design.md) wherever possible. There are end use cases where this is not practical. 

## Starting a new design 
Before doing anything, when starting a new part design without a previous reference, you should reference the experts in the field for a specific part type. Be sure to try and develop frameworks for designing specific part types that can be easily reused in the future. For example:
