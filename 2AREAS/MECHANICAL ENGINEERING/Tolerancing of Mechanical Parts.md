## Description 
This note is on the proper tolerancing, or sizing, of mechanical parts which touch or mate in some way. Systems such as [Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing](Geometric%20Dimensioning%20and%20Tolerancing) are outside the scope of this note. This is a more general reference for sizing parts.
