GraFoil® Flexible Graphite

GraFoil® material was first introduced in 1967 as the original flexible graphite technology. This graphite foil was quickly utilized as the first fluid sealing material made exclusively from pure, natural graphite flake. Its resistance to heat, fire, corrosion, and aggressive chemicals makes it the most universally applicable sealing solution in the market today. GraFoil flexible graphite has successfully been used in a wide array of applications across many industries including:

- Oil and gas
- Chemical plants
- Refining and petrochemical industries
- Automotive gasketing
- Nuclear and industrial gasketing
- Infrastructure
- Power generation
- Pharmaceuticals
- Battery systems
