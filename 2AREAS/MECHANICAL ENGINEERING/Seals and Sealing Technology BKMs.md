# Description

[Orings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring) (AKA O-rings, O'rings) and Seals are used in Vacuum Chambers to keep the chamber at a lower pressure than the outside atmosphere.  In the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry the primary causes of failure are chemical attack, excessive temperature, mechanical degradation, or improper installation.
