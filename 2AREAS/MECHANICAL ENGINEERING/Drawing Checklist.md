## Description 
This is intended as a general checklist for checking mechanical part drawings, more specific checklists should be made for specific use cases and companies. Checklist items are listed in subjective order of importance.

## Design

- [ ] Fit check in next higher assembly with no interferences, fully constrained.
- [ ] Dimensions match tolerance calculations
- [ ] O-ring grooves are sized appropriately
- [ ] O-ring grooves have inner surface relief to avoid rubbing
- [ ] O-ring grooves have tool entry features and locations identified
- [ ] Sealing surfaces have appropriate surface finish/coating
- [ ] Locating features are present and look correct in CAD.
- [ ] Mounting hardware to next higher assembly and surrounding components is present and appropriately dimensioned
- [ ] Features to dodge existing hardware are present and properly dimensioned
- [ ] Embedded hardware uses Lam parts where applicable
- [ ] Correct size and length for inserts (Helicoils, Pems, etc.), both for assembly hole and the intended hardware
- [ ] CTRL+P Release

## Drawing

- [ ] material, cleanliness, coating, packaging, handling, finish specification are appropriate
- [ ] Locating features are dimensioned correctly following [GD&T Guidelines](GD&T%20Guidelines.md)
- [ ] Edge break note appropriate for coating if applicable - [Anodization Design Standards](Anodization%20Design%20Standards.md)
- [ ] Standard size chamfer/radii where applicable
- [ ] Minimize tooling changes (using same radii where available)
- [ ] No obvious drawing errors (overlapping item balloons, leader lines incorrect, etc...)
- [ ] Latest drawing template used with correct block tolerances
- [ ] Leader notes on drawing match notes block
- [ ] Poke yoke features used where available/applicable
    - [ ] Alignment pins, non-symmetric hole patterns, etc.
