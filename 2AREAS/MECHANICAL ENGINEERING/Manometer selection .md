calibration is done in the top decade 10%-100% of full scale

All manometers scale from 0-10 volts, manometers are defined upon the 100% value. For example, a 100 Torr manometer is 100% signal at 100 Torr. 

Risk at the lower decade, Rule of thumb is keep it at above 50mV for reading, for any sort of control purposes, keep it at 100mV, if we want to keep it at rated accuracy, keep it at the top decade. 

This is for MKS manometers.
