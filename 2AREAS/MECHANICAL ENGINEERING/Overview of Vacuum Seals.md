- Nickel gasket is compressed between two stainless steel glands and permanently deformed to form a seal
- New VCR gasket required every disconnect
- Application: Small diameter stainless steel tube assemblies for gas delivery in medium to ultra high vacuum systems


> [!NOTE] TIPS
> - Use Ultra High Purity fittings for critical gas delivery applications

## VCO
![](../../3RESOURCES/PUBLIC%20ASSETS/Pasted%20image%2020240226101833.png)

- Elastomer seal (o-ring) compressed between two stainless steel tube fittings to form a seal
- Suppliers frequently apply lubricant to VCO o-rings (not acceptable for Lam systems)
- Application: Small diameter stainless steel tube assemblies for gas delivery with frequent connecting/disconnecting in medium to high vacuum systems

> [!NOTE] TIPS
> - Use FFKM elastomers (Chemraz/Kalrez etc.) for high temp and corrosive chemistry applications
> - Use VCR seals instead of VCO seals whenever possible

- Elastomer seal (o-ring) compressed between stainless steel tube fitting and OD of tube to form a seal
- Application: Small diameter stainless steel tube assemblies for gas delivery that require positional compliance in medium to high vacuum systems


> [!NOTE] TIPS
> - Use FFKM elastomers (Chemraz/Kalrez etc.) for high temp and corrosive chemistry applications
> - Use VCR seals instead of Ultra-Torr seals whenever possible
