# 11-20-23 Journal

I have been feeling lazy today and this weekend. Hence why I have not updated my Journal in a few days. I haven't really had a good night or morning routine set up yet. I made an attempt today to set that up and put it in my calendar. 

[Tiffany](../../../../../../2AREAS/RELATIONSHIPS/PEOPLE/Tiffany%20Tarrant.md) and I went out to go see the buttertones at Rickshaw stop which was great. Although she doesn't really dance which is a bit of a buzzkill but I'll allow it. I had a great time with her though, we walked and talked and grabbed espresso martinis. She's a great gal. I awkwardly asked if we could make out at the end of the night. Like a beggar asking for some change. She ended up coming back to my place and we made out for an hour or so on my bed. It was really hot. She has such a thick and nice body and she is a great kisser. I like the little noises she makes when we kiss and the way she looks at me. 

I like her I want to continue that relationship and see what happens. It's fun being with an older woman, I feel like she is more secure in herself. Maybe it will help me be more secure in myself. 

I think she got me sick though. I was so tired today and felt myself coming down with something, I hope that doesn't continue though, I really hate being sick. 

I got a peloton! It is making it so easy to work out. And I can do zone 2 cardio for really extended periods of time because I just gotta get on the peloton and watch some Netflix. It's great, I think it's really gonna help me reach my fitness goals.
