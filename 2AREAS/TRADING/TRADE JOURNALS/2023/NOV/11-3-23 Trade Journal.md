### TNON
- kind of just consolidating after it's run up in premarket
- ![Pasted image 20231103065255](../../../../../3RESOURCES/PUBLIC%20ASSETS/Pasted%20image%2020231103065255.png)
- I put an alert at 1.4 and will not pay attention to it unless that goes off, seems to be resistance. 
### CPS
- on a run up approaching high of day (HOD) at 18.5, I will put an alert at 18.25 and see what happens, I think it is a bit over extended.

### FNKO
- Big sell off, seems ripe for a reversal

- If it breaks VWAP I will buy
### LOCL
- Nothing much going on here

### CYTO
- Seems like it is just selling off after high in premarket
- Could bounce off the 200 EMA, put an alert at 0.202 to check for that

### CVRX
- On a five minute pullback, seems pretty low volume, kinda hesitant about this one, put an alert at 18 and will buy if I see another run.

- Bought after the first green candle, but i feel like it's selling off now, I should wait for confirmation next time, got in with **1500 shares at $18.11**
