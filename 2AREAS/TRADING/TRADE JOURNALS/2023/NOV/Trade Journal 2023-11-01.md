### PIXY
- 7am 
	- If it breaks above VWAP ($6.7) I will buy

	- Bought right here, saw it pop above 7 but now I'm worried it just bounced back down. We'll see, logging off for the day. 

### MNPR
- 7:01
	- Looks like maybe there is an uptrend forming, but I doubt it. Highest volume is on red candles

### SOPA
- 7:02
	- Nothing much going on here

### ZVSA 
- 7:03
	- Looks like it has dipped to the 200 EMA, maybe will bounce, will keep an eye on it. However, most of the volume was in premarket so I don't think this is coming back to life.
