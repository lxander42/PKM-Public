## By ticker 
### TWO 
- 6:54
	- on a pretty big run  
	- ![Pasted image 20231031065321](../../ATTACHMENTS/Pasted%20image%2020231031065321.png)
	- I plan on buying if it has a major pullback to VWAP (pink) around $11 it seems like it is petering out

### SPRC 
- 6:54
	- Nothing much going on here. 

### VSME 
- 6:54
	- Nothing much going on here, kind of in a downtrend.

### CDIO
- 6:56
	- Lots of movement, I feel like I could capture something
	- Seems like maybe it is in a wedge pattern
	- ![Pasted image 20231031065736](../../ATTACHMENTS/Pasted%20image%2020231031065736.png)
	- I'm gonna check back at 7:15, if it breaks out to the upside, I will buy
- 7:00
	- It broke out sooner, I placed a bracket order with a stop loss at VWAP
