### P&L by Trade Duration
![Pasted image 20231106075250](../../../../../3RESOURCES/PUBLIC%20ASSETS/Pasted%20image%2020231106075250.png)
As you can see, most of my successful trades are within the first 10 minutes, I should cut off trades after 10 minutes if they are not successful.

## Strategy notes throughout the month
**How it's going**
- I think I am losing most of the time. 
- I think the problem is I keep feeling like I have to make a trade 
- I also am trading stocks that maybe are not the most obvious choice of the day
- There is no clarity around bet sizing, obviously the risks are outlined above, but I haven't been able to systematically determine where to put my stop losses or take profit where I want to. 
- I need to look at my winning trades when the month is up and try and find a pattern to use on my next strategy, I'll use [Tradervue Trading Journal - Journal, Analyze, and Share your trades](https://www.tradervue.com/)

### Next Month's Ideas
- come up with a way to refine the stocks you trade to only be the most profitable ones
- Adjust your bet sizing to the capital available
- Find an average time range to cut off losers within and be ruthless about it 
- The same thing for winners, extend them as long as they will go when looking at the average winner 
- Start a journaling template with why you entered trades

DO: 
- Wait for bull flag confirmation on the 1 minute or 5 minute, green candle on the tape
- Only use limit orders. 
- Set stop losses at bottom of previous low, P/L sized at 2:1
- Set risk (in cents) at 2X ATR initially, adjust manually after placing the order
- Cut off trades after 10 minutes if not successful

DO NOT: 
- Trade reversals
- Buy micro pullbacks on the 1 min chart
- Trade after large doge or topping tail
- Trade on a >50% pullback from previous run up or if it dips below VWAP
