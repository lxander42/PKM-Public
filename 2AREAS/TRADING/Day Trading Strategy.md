## Bet sizing

- Risk no more than 1% of capital ($75K)
- Aim for 2 P/L ratio
- **Various risk sizes (to be updated monthly as capital changes):**
	- 1c - 2c : 50,000
	- 3c - 5c : 18,750
	- 6c - 10c: 9375
	- 11c - 20c: 4875
	- 21c - 40c: 2625
	- 41c - 60c: 1500
	- 61c - 80c: 1125
	- 81c - $1: 825
	- $1.01 - $1.5: 600
	- $1.51 - $2: 427
	- $2.01 - $3: 300
	- $3.01 - $6: 167
	- $6.01 - $10: 94
- Formula: shares = (Capital * risk percentage)/cents risked per share
	- Example (75000x0.01)/0.015 = 50000 shares for a 1.5 cent risk with 75000 in capital

## Notes
**How it's going**

## Next month's ideas 
Consider implementing the flat top trading strategy: 
### The Bull Flag Pattern vs the Flat Top Breakout Pattern

The most significant difference between a bull flag pattern and a flat top breakout pattern is that in the flat top pattern, the consolidation occurs just below the high. It doesn’t pull back in a meaningful way.

So while a bull flag experiences 2-3 red candles that can pull back to the 9-period exponential moving average, the flat top breakout consolidates within a few cents of the highs.

Here is a challenge with flat top breakouts: the entry is at the high of day. It’s a more extended entry compared with a bull flag.

I may still be able to set my max loss at the low of the pattern, but if the stock cannot hold the breakout level, I typically exit the trade immediately.
