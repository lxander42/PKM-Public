# **The Process**

- Loosely based on Ben Levin's ideas on [how to write songs faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siJeW_HiH7c)
- All recording, mixing and mastering done with [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/)

## *Phase 1: Ideation*

> [!WARNING]
> Try to get through the ideation phase as quickly as possible, you can refine later

1. Generate song name or make one up (you can change later)
2. Lay down a [random](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=161&q=random+number+generator&cvid=a4e7f9182f8741daa550952d0aa61475&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEAAYQDIGCAAQABhAMgYIARAAGEAyBggCEAAYQDIGCAMQABhAMgYIBBAAGEAyBggFEAAYQDIGCAYQABhAMgYIBxAAGEAyBggIEAAYQNIBCDI4NzFqMGoxqAIAsAIA&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531) drum loop from your drum loops folder or find a new one
3. Record 1 set of guitar chords/lead (optional)
	- Note chords below
4. Record 2nd set of guitar chords/lead (optional) in the same key as the first
	- Note chords below
5. Move project to "Needs Vocals" folder

## *Phase 2: Vocals*

1. Mumble, croon, or shriek to all the songs in your "needs vocals" folder until you fill up the entire space with good vocal ideas. Try to do this without vocal effects so you can really focus on the melody
2. Move to "Starter Songs" folder

## *Phase 3: Development*

1. Add bass, synthesizers, rerecord guitar in your "Starter Songs" until you get a really good sounding mix to develop your lyrics over.
2. Add new song parts if you feel it is necessary, play around with using [interesting musical concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXxX013s1Vk) to season your idea. 
3. Develop and hone your lyrics and write them down (See songwriting template)
4. Record a clean take without effects and keep rerecording parts until you feel it is perfect

## *Phase 4: Refinement*

1. Add vocal effects and backing vocals which complement the instruments
2. Mix and master according to [Vocal mixing guide](../../PKM-Public/2AREAS/MUSIC/Vocal%20mixing%20guide.md)
