# Description

The basic structure of drum patterns and kits within Ableton, used for [Songwriting](Songwriting.md). I use this structure for all drum kits so that I can re-use midi patterns throughout all my songs and just switch out drum kits. 

Drum kits in ableton are laid out in a 4x4 grid, shown below for the standard 808 drum kit:

We organize percussion sounds into 3 categories, somewhat following [a non-drummers guide to writing drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOV8I4n6v8&t=957s): 

- Low drums
	- kick drum
	- floor toms
	- stomps
	- synthetic kicks
	- etc..
- Medium drums
	- snare
	- claps 
	- snaps
	- shakers
	- wood drums
	- congas
- High drums
	- high hats
	- tambourines
	- triangle
	- various cymbals

Each family occupies a different part of an acoustic space, each drum composition is usually composed of 1 instrument from each section. This is an oversimplification but it is helpful. 

I should dive into the video linked above more in the future to refine my drum composition but for now we will keep it simple. 

**The 4x4 grid**: 

| Medium Drum 4 (shaker) | High Drum 5 (crash)     | High Drum 4                   | High Drum 1 (ride)    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Low Drum 2 (low tom)   | Low Drum 3 (mid tom)    | High Drum 3 (open high hat)   | Low Drum 4 (high tom) |
| Medium Drum 5          | Medium Drum 6           | High Drum 2 (closed high hat) | Medium Drum 7         |
| Low Drum 1 (kick)      | Medium Drum 2 (rimshot) | Medium Drum 1 (snare)         | Medium Drum 3 (clap)  |

I based the numbering on how Ableton structures its default drum kits and the frequency with which I use certain sounds. For example, I use Low Drum 1 (kick) more frequently than I use Low Drum 2 (low tom).**
