I need to define a standard setup for recording with instructions for hardware, software, plugins, technique, etc... I keep having to relearn it every time. 

This is using the Scarlet Solo

**Setting up the Focusrite in Ableton**

- Go to Options>Preferences

- Change sample rate if necessary
- Increasing or decreasing buffer size is the time that is given to your software to process and playback your effects, low buffer for low latency

**Recording Audio**
- Plug in microphone and guitar as shown, with guitar having the "inst" option enabled
