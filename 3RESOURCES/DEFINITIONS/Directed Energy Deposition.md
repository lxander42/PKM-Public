# Description

Directed Energy Deposition (Dead) allows for the creation of objects by melting the material (most frequently used for metals such as titanium, aluminum, stainless steel or copper) in powder or as a wire with a focused energy source as it is deposited by a nozzle on a surface (Ashish _et al_., 2019). In a Dead printer, the nozzle head moves around a fixed object for depositing the material in specific locations (Shamsaei _et al_., 2015; Thompson _et al_., 2015).eadespite it is possible to build full parts with Dead techniques, they are typically employed for repairing or adding additional material to existing objects.
