## Definition
Product option architecture, or POA, is a way of structuring a commercial product with many different options for an end user. The full POA Bill of Materials ([BOM](../../../2AREAS/MECHANICAL%20ENGINEERING/BOM.md)) is often called a 150% BOM, this includes all possible configurations for a given product. For example, a product may include options for high temperature operation, increased power output, more compact form factors, and budget options, which all with different benefits and drawbacks. 

When a final option is selected, the unwanted assemblies are removed from the POA BOM and the BOM becomes a "100% BOM," meaning that the product is complete and includes no more than it is supposed to.
