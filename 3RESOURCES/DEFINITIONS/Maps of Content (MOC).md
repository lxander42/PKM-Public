## Description 

[Maps of Content (MOC)](Maps%20of%20Content%20(MOC).md) are a note containing links to other notes. It’s a meta note that can be thought of as an index of notes on a specific topic, question, perspective, or area of interest. Just like a table of contents. [While each note can only be stored in a single folder on your computer, many MOCs can link to the same note](https://www.dsebastien.net/2022-05-15-maps-of-content/). 

In the beginning, [Maps of Content (MOC)](Maps%20of%20Content%20(MOC).md) should not be organized, they should be just dropped into the note, only after you reach a critical mass should you start organizing the MOC.
