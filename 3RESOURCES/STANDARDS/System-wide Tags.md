## Description 
This document outlines the proper use of various tags within this [Personal Knowledge Management](../../2AREAS/PERSONAL%20KNOWLEDGE%20MANAGEMENT/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) System.

Want to modify this eventually to include elements from [pjeby/tag-wrangler: Rename, merge, toggle, and search tags from the Obsidian tag pane (github.com)](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler).

## Rules

All notes should only have 1 description tag, they are akin to categories. They should be contained in the metadata of the note. Status tags define the status of an item. They should be contained in the body of the note. For example, items I want to research later have the "research" tag. this is still a work in progress. 

Any tag which is in the body of a note should be accompanied with the following addendum: (see [System-wide Tags](System-wide%20Tags.md))
