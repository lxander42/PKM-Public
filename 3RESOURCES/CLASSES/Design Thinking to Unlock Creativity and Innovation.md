## Notes: 
### Day 1 
Goals: 
- Build innovation skills: add design thinking as part of expertise. 
- Experience the innovation process firsthand
- Think about how we can use these new skills in our daily work 

We will go beyond: 
- The burden of being an expert 
	- don't feel like you have to be an expert 
- Hating uncertainty 
- Fear of failure 
- Planning everything in advance before doing anything 
- Trusting only data 

#### Design thinking process 
- Inspiration
	- Gain empathy
- Ideation 
	- Brainstorm possibilities 
- Implementation 
	- Make Ideas tangible by prototyping and storytelling 

Look into [Bauhaus](../../../3RESOURCES/INTERIOR%20DESIGN/Bauhaus.md) school of design

Human factors: what's desirable for people 
organization factors: what's desirable for an organization 
tech factors: is a design feasible

During a design process, we vary from divergent to convergent thinking:

Advantages of design thinking: 
- better for people 
- Builds tangibility and momentum
	- makes projects go faster 
- Reduces risk
	- prototype and fail early to succeed sooner

Designers build to think
 - this means they prototype many times

When to use design thinking: 
 - when people are involved 
 - tough problems
 - openness to new ideas 

##### Embrace the Beta 
- try the new process in beta early 

##### Open up to your fullest potential 
- trust the collective intelligence
- Design with, not just for 

##### Model the behaviors you desire 
- be the change you want to see in the world 

##### Inspiration 
Look at extreme cases

- Look in and Look out 
	- look in and outside of the company 

###### Inspiration/Listening Methods 

- Secondary research 
- Interviews 
- Observations 
- Field Trips 

###### Gathering design inspiration 
- usually observe and talk with people in natural contexts 
- Video to simulate the observation experience 
	- look for things that surprise you 
	- Observe body language 
	- Empathize 
	- Look for triggers, hurdles and workarounds 
	- Video observations: 
		- their location looks pretty sparse, uncomfortable
			- the initial location 
		- only professional shopper leaves cart at certain places 
			- shopping carts are really large 
		- what are all the cubes for?
		- why haven't cart designs changed then?
		- Their boss was relatively uncontrolling
		- 
Synthesizing the data from the movie 

Data 
- eclectic team 
- divide and conquer to get different teams 
- Process 
	- deep dive
	- narrow 
	- refine
-  college dorm room environment 
-  looking for the baskets can be hard sometimes
	-  there is going to have to be someone working full time to track down these things 
-  seating for the child 
	-  not very secure 
-  Boss was the last to know, very hands off. 
-  The team was t-type, diverse background, but everyone had an expert skill 
-  everyone was having so much fun working together
-  team decides what works and what doesn't, what eventually goes in the next iteration

### Day 2
#### Overview
- intros to ideation methods and brainstorming 
- practice brainstorming
- synthesize what we learned 
- intros to prototyping and storytelling 
- do some quick prototyping 
- examples of how design thinking is used of Lam
- QA/next steps 
#### Duct Tape Surfing 
#### Ideation 
- bodystorming: use your bodies to try out and improve on new ideas
	- example being: cuddle class
		-  seats that turn into a couch on air new zealand 
- useful when problems are spatial and environmental 
- 100 ways anything can be different 
- Card sorting 
- Draw your ideal

##### Brainstorming
- go for quantity 
- defer judgment
- build on the ideas of others 
- stay focused on the topic 
- once conversation at a time 
- be visual
- encourage wild ideas 

###### How might we hold better virtual meetings at Lam?
- company wide policy to limit meetings to only the first half of the day. 
- Encourage eating and casual behavior during meetings 
- require the meeting owner to wear groucho glasses
- encourage the autonomy for people to decline meetings 
- virtual reality meetings with interactive components and haptic feedback. 
- automatic scribing for meetings, nobody has to scribe, an AI does it all 
- company wide policy where no meeting is required. 
- random 1 on 1s with the CEO 
- Better UI for Leap Classes, professional voice actors, writers, etc... 
- Leap classes on cooking and other misc skills 
- random meeting button 
- "im bored" button in meetings 
- automatic mute if someone is hogging the conversation 

#### Practice: Write a press release 
- on our brainstorming topic
- write a headline
- one or two additional sentences that describes your idea
- Include a quote from lam exec (that you make up)
- Write a sentence that describes the possible impact 

#### Press Release: AI Scribes to Hold More Effective Meetings 
With the recent developments in AI, it is now possible to have an AI capture meeting minutes, action items, and points of note in meetings across Lam. This will remove the need for someone to scribe and can be implemented with automatic reminders to make sure that everyone knows what the meeting was about. This AI acts as an additional person in each meeting and can be interacted with as another colleague!

Billy Boberson (CTO) had this to say: "i have become friends with this AI, with the built in chatbot features, I don't even need a therapist anymore!"

The impacts of this are far-reaching and will eventually be implemented company-wide, not just in meetings. Imagine having a virtual assistant to schedule meetings, take notes, perform research, or look up all relevant info for a project for you. The possibilities are endless!

#### Storytelling:
